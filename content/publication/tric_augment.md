abstract = "We describe a patch augmentation of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve to address tricuspid valve regurgitation due to leaflet retraction. The area of the anterior leaflet is measured using a tricuspid valve annuloplasty sizer; a glutaraldehyde-fixed autologous pericardial patch is trimmed with slight 5 mm oversize. The anterior leaflet is detached and the patch is sutured with three 5/0 running interlocked sutures, then an annuloplasty is performed with an undersized ring. This technique offers an easy and reproducible tool to address tricuspid regurgitation due to lack of leaflet coaptation"
