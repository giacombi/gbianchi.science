Moreover many report raised not only the issue of inter-scientists reproducibility but also consistency in the same group of co-worker. Here I reproduce the results of a famous paper about digoxin therapy in heart failure published by the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997. Thanks to the National Heart and Blood Institute of the United States, the complete anonymized dataset has been relase. The goal of the whole project is to teach the data scientist toolbox and analytic mindset to go through the analysis and reporting using Literate Programming. This will serve as example to teach how easy is reproducible research with R.","tags":["reproducible research","medicine","biostatistics","teaching"],"title":"Reproducible Research - Example from NEJM paper","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"cb0a718d3134541cc94fdb9f6b3ce0dc","permalink":"https://drgbianchi.netlify.com/talk/dd_mithology/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/dd_mithology/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Example Talk","type":"talk"}]
